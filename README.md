This module provides functions to load REST API descriptor files and help the implementation of both servers and clients that communicates through the API.

There are two main approach to use this module.
- Use the `loadOas()` function from the `oas` module (preferred).
- Use the `services` module that is made for the `rest-tool` (deprecated).

Read the [API documentation](https://tombenke.github.io/rest-tool-common/index.html)
for further details on how to use this library.

## The OAS way

Use the `loadOas()` function that needs the path to the root descriptor file of either a swagger v2.0 or OpenApi v3.0 file.
The function loads the whole description, even they are distributed among several partials, then returns an object the porvides further functions that makes available the endpoints of the API.

Find examples for both [static](fixtures/oas/v2-combined-static-endpoints.json) and [non-static](fixtures/oas/v2-combined-nonstatic-endpoints.json) endpoints under the fixtures.

Read the [oas module documentation](https://tombenke.github.io/rest-tool-common/module-oas.html)
for further details.

## The rest-tool way

The 'rest-tool' is a simple Node.js command-line tool which can be used to document,
emulate and test RESTful APIs. 

This project is a Node.js module, that is used by the 'rest-tool' itself,
and the REST API projects, that are generated by the tool.

This module is referred by the package.json files and automatically installed during the normal usage 
of the 'rest-tool', so you probably will not use it directly unless you are willing to develop 
your own code generator or templates.

Read the [services module documentation](https://tombenke.github.io/rest-tool-common/module-services.html)
for further details.
